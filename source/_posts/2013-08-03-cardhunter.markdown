I knew it was going to happen. After spending upwards of $150 on the Steam summer sale, a friend introduces me to a nice free-to-play in-browser game called Card Hunter and now its the only thing I play in my free time. What am I going to do with myself?

Card Hunter, made by the equisitely named Blu Manchu, is a turn-based strategy and tactics game (ala Final Fantasy Tactics) mixed with trading card mechanics (ala Magic the Gathering). You control a party of three characters customized from a choice of 3 races (the hardened dwarves, the nimble elves, and the pinacle of normality humans) and 3 classes (warrior, wizard, and cleric) as you explore a map littered with D&D like adventures, each populated with 1-4 combat scenarios. Upon winning (whether by defeating all enemies or fulfilling some kind of victory condition) you are showered with loot in the form of cards that you can equip on to your characters to give them additional armor and abilities.

The strategy in the game is defined by how well you outfit your characters for an adventure and how well you take advantage of the terrain as you position them to engage against the ravenous hoards that bear down you. 

Oddly, my favorite part of the game is the aethestic. The graphics are modeled after what a traditional real world board game would look like, complete with background deck and dice for added visual appeal. The models are all two dimensional cutouts that, while attacking and moving, have very little in the way of animation, but still evoke a strong charm to the imagination.

The game itself is challenging, sometimes frustrating, because like all TCGs, elements of randomness from the simulated dice rolls and card draws are a huge factor into how you choose to strategize and you can quickly find yourself resigning a battle just after it begins to dawn on you how strongly luck is not on your side.

This is one of the more friendlier F2P games I've played recently. There are things the game does to remind you that you could be having more fun if you ponied up some real coin, but none of it is annoying. And while the game would be a tad easier, there's no guarantee. So not paying doesn't feel like playing with a handicap.

Overall, this game is pretty awesome. A-
